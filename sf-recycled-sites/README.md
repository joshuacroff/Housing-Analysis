# Project Description

Identify any sites in San Francisco's Cycle 6 Housing Element Electronic Housing Inventory that were used in the Cycle 4 and/or Cycle 5 Housing Elements.

For nonvacant sites recycled from the 5th cycle OR the 4th cycle, and for vacant sites used in both the 4th AND 5th cycles, the following applies:

> “Include a program in the housing element requiring rezoning within three years of the beginning of the planning period to allow residential use by right at specified densities (see Step 2) for housing developments in which at least 20 percent of the units are affordable to lower income households. This program can be an overlay on these specific sites. Please be aware that the intent of this requirement is to further incentivize the development of housing on sites that have been available over one or more planning periods. The application of the requirement should not be used to further constrain the development of housing. As such, housing developments that do not contain the requisite 20 percent would still be allowed to be developed according to the underlying (base) zoning but would not be eligible for “by right” processing. However, the jurisdiction would have to make findings on the approval of that project pursuant to No Net Loss Law (Government Code section 65863) and proceed to identify an alternative site or sites pursuant to that law. Sites where zoning already permits residential “use by right” as set forth in Government Code section 65583.2 (i) at the beginning of the planning period would be considered to meet this requirement.”
